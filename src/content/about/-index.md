With a lifelong passion for technology, and over 30 years of industry experience, I help bootstrapped startups and small businesses build scalable, automated systems that drive growth. From full-stack development to streamlining operations, I specialize in creating efficient, low-cost solutions that support long-term business success.

My background is varied, and aside from the standard tech fare (e-comm, social networks, digital marketing, crypto) I've worked across a number of industries - engineering, education, vacation rentals, art galleries, gaming, matchmaking, travel... As an independent entrepreneur for over 25 years, my understanding goes beyond the low level technical requirements, with a top to bottom view of process integration and systems management across your business.  Graduating from BCIT (with cerifications and education in network security, artificial intelligence and management information systems) taught me how to be constantly learning to keep up in a rapidly changing industry, and has enabled me to dance across tech stacks, be multi-lingual with programming languages, and build a long term vantage of challenges and anticipated pitfalls.  

I'm a builder and a problem solver and love to work with an owner to discuss their frustrations and pain points, look ahead to where they want to go, and take responsibility for crafting a comfortable, dependable and secure solution that elevates their success.
